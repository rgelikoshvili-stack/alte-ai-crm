# Production Readiness Decision

Current decision: `NO-GO_FOR_ACTUAL_DEPLOYMENT`

Reason: GitHub backup/tag, deployment docs, Claude live validation, Docker/Cloud Run docs, project/region/CORS and billing are recorded. Cloud SQL pilot tier direction is approved and Secret preparation docs are created, but actual deployment remains blocked until Secret Manager creation is approved/completed, website access, privacy approval, and explicit resource-creation approval are completed.

## Go Only If

- [x] GitHub remote exists. Current remote: `https://github.com/rgelikoshvili-stack/alte-ai-crm`.
- [x] Release tag exists. `v0.8-deployment-ready` was pushed.
- [x] Tests pass. Latest Phase 8D-GitHub check: `110 passed` with `AI_PROVIDER=mock`.
- [ ] Docker build passes. Not run in this prep step.
- [ ] `startup_check` passes with production-like env. Local/dev check passed; production-like Secret Manager values are not configured yet.
- [x] Google Cloud project selected. `PROJECT_ID=project-1e145fd0-c30e-4aac-a34`.
- [x] Billing understood. User confirmed billing is enabled.
- [x] Cloud SQL cost/tier direction accepted for pilot. Recommended option: Low-cost pilot production tier. Exact final price still must be reviewed during actual resource creation.
- [ ] Anthropic key created and stored in Secret Manager.
- [x] CORS origins confirmed. `https://alte.edu.ge,https://join.alte.edu.ge`.
- [ ] Alte website admin/developer access confirmed.
- [x] Rollback plan documented. See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_RISK_REGISTER.md`.
- [ ] Data privacy owner approves.

## Current Recommended Values
